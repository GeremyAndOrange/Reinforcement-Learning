# Reinforcement-Learning
It's a project about learning reinfoecement learning!


# Summary
The learning process of reinforcement learning this time has gained some understanding of the ideas of reinforcement learning, but there is still a lot of room for improvement in specific algorithms and applications.

Afterwards, RL learning will be temporarily put on hold for a period of time, and the next learning project will focus on the ROS2 operating system.
